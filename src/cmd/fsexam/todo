Request from Eric
    Need conversion in batch mode 
    CLI mode converion (unlikely)
    Nautilus integration support.


More features:
  * symbolic link support - it is hard to implement
  * Windows carriage return and line return (0x0a0d --> 0x0a)
    MS-Windows \r\n
    Unix       \n
    Macintosh or mail boday \r
    Default conversion can be changed by the preference dialog

  * Don't display hidden files - DONE
  * Fix collation issue - DONE
  * Add nautilus-similar toolbar

  * Enable user to remove and add encoding from encoding list

Two tasks recently:
 * write some testcase, do testing - DONE
 * write english help, currently there only has a outline  - DONE

Several features in order of priority are still needed:

  * file content conversion, check with 'file utility' whether the file is 
    plain text file with help of suffix exclusion such as ".htm", ".html" etc,
    display one popup window to show the first hundrads of multi-bytes
    text by double-clicking on the file item and give user one option to
    decide the encoding.  -DONE

  * nautilus integration, with it user can left-click on the file icon
    to lauch the application.

  * activated by bonobo, in which way we can guarantee that only one window
    exists on desktop.

Of course, it would be better to fix several minor bugfix at first,

  * GtkItemFactoryEntry is deprecated already and fsexam's menu should be i18ned
    at first   - DONE

  * use 256 as buffer size is stupid, it can't work if the length of directory 
    name supress it. - DONE

  * no help information. - DONE

  * Add "File-->Save As..." to save the conversion result - DONE

  * Add "Action-->Undo 2" to make undo on the item that is selected - OBSOLETED

  * Add the typical golden star icon on the "Help-->About" item to keep consistency with
    other GNOME applications - DONE

  * Add "Help-->Content" menu item - DONE
