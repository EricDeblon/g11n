fxexam is one tool to help user migrate from legacy encoding to UTF8
on your system. Given one directory, one tree view is displayed to
list all files and subdirectories and the file name that isn't in 
UTF8 encoding will be displayed as one sequence of question marks.

The tool can use a list of encoding that is specified for the current
language to do conversion, and rename the filename in legacy encoding
with corresponding one in UTF8 on your system
