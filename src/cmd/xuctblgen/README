Some info on how to use the xuctblgen:

1. This tool is an internal utility and not at all easy to use.
   I just hope this short writeup has some useful info that people can
   use.

2. Due to recent security fix in libX11 as of 3/2002, we should
   define XLOCALEDIR macro during the compile-time of the sources
   (especially for tblgen.c). Also, during the use of the utility, you
   should provide XLOCALEDIR environment variable pointing to
   your target destination directory where you save conv table sources and
   also target binary conv tables.

3. There are several command line options:

   -locale <locale>	You must supply this option with your locale
			name to successfully build your locale's conv
			tables.

   -codeset_num <num>	You must supply this option with the number of
			charsets in your locale, i.e., XLC_LOCALE file.

   -use_common_dir	Optional. If supplied, the xuctblgen utility will
			try to read conv table source files and also try to
			write binary conv tables at the following location:

			$XLOCALEDIR/usr/openwin/lib/locale/common/conv_tables/

			If not specified, by default, the utility will try to
			read the conv table source files and also try to
			write the binary conv tables at the locale's
			conv_tables directory:

			$XLOCALEDIR/usr/openwin/lib/locale/<locale>/conv_tables/

			Even though you don't specify this option, during
			the read attempt only, the utility will also try to
			read the conv table source files from the common
			conv_tables directory if it wasn't able to
			find the source files from the locale's conv_tables
			directory.

			Most likely no need to be used during your locale's
			conv table generations.

   -no_wc_to_cs_tables	Optional. If specified, the xuctblgen utility will not
			generate conversion tables such as U32_TO_CS_0,
			U32_TO_CS_1, and so on.

			Most likely no need to be used during your locale's
			conv table generations.

   -no_cs_to_wc_tables	Optional. If specified, the xuctblgen utility will not
			generate conversion tables such as ISO8859-2.GR,
			JISX0208-0.GR, GB2312-0.GR, and so on that
			you specified in the "cs_conversion_table" lines of
			the XLC_LOCALE file. This will save you some build
			time since most locales are using the common
			conv tables at:
			
			/usr/openwin/lib/locale/common/conv_tables/

			and thus you don't need to generate those files.

			Most likely need to be used!
