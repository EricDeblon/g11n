.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mp
program reads each
.I filename
in sequence and generates a prettified version of the contents in
\*(Ps format, sent to standard output.
If no filename argument is provided,
.B mp
reads the standard input.
If the standard input is a terminal, input is terminated by an
.SM EOF
signal, usually
.SM Ctrl-D\s0.
.LP
The
.B mp
program accepts international text file of various Solaris locales and produces output which is proper for the specified locale. The output will also contain proper text layout, for instance, bidirectional text rendering, and shaping as the complex text layout (CTL) is supported in the 
.B mp.
.LP
Depending on the each locale's system font configuration for 
.B mp
the 
\*(Ps output file can contain glyph images from Solaris system-resident scalable or bitmap fonts.
.LP
Mail items, news articles, ordinary ASCII files, complete mail folders,
and digests are all acceptable input formats for
.BR mp .
The output format includes grayscale lozenges containing banner information
at the top and bottom of every page.
.LP
The program is conveniently used in conjunction with the print button of the
.BR mailtool (1)
program, or the
.I pipe
command provided by
.BR mail (1).
Add the following two lines to your \fB.mailrc\fP
file:
.br
.in +1.0i
.nf
\fBset printmail='mp | lp'
set cmd="mp | lp &"\fP
.fi
.in -1.0i
.LP
Source the \fB.mailrc\fP file, and you are ready to use \fBmp\fP.
For printing ordinary ASCII files, the following alias (to be placed in your \fB.cshrc\fP file) may also prove useful:
.br
.in +1.0i
.nf
\fBalias print 'mp -o -s "\\!*" <\\!* | lp'\fP
.fi
.in -1.0i
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A4
Use A4 paper size (8.5 x 11.4 inches).
.TP
.B \-C
Instead of using "\\nFrom" to denote the start of new mail messages,
.B mp
will look for (and use) the value of the Content-Length: mail header. If the
Content-Length doesn't take you to the next "\\nFrom", then it's wrong, and
.B mp
falls back to looking for the next "\\nFrom" in the mail folder.
.TP
.B \-F
Instead of printing who the mail article is for, the top header will
contain who the mail article is from. A useful option for people with
their own personal printer.
.TP
.BI \-L "  localename"
Provide the locale of the file to be printed. If this command line option is
not present, then
.B mp
looks for the
.I MP_LANG
environment variable. If that is not present, then the
.I LANG
environment variable is used. If none of these options are present, then
.B mp
tries to determine the locale it is running in, and if it cannot, then it
assumes it is running in the C locale, otherwise a prologue file
specific to the given locale is prepended to the output. This is to provide
I18N level 4 (multibyte) printing.
.TP 
.B \-PS
If the mail or digest message just has PostScript as the text of the message,
then this is normally just passed straight through. Specifying this option,
causes PostScript to be printed as text.
.TP
.B \-US
Use US paper size (8.5 x 11 inches).
This is the default paper size.
.TP
.B \-a
Format the file as a news article.
The top banner contains the text:
"Article from \fInewsgroup\fP", where \fInewsgroup\fP
is the first news group found on the 'Newsgroups:' line.
.TP
.BI \-c " chars"
The maximum number of characters to extract from the gecos field of the users
\fB/etc/passwd\fP entry. The default is 18.
.TP
.B \-d
Format the file as a digest.
.TP
.B \-e
Assume the ELM mail frontend intermediate file format. Used when printing
messages from within ELM (using the "p" command), especially for printing
tagged messages. This option must be specified in your ELM option setup.
.TP
.B \-ff
Format the file for use with a Filofax personal organizer.
.TP
.B \-fp
Format the file for use with a Franklin Planner personal organizer.
.TP
.B \-l
Format output in landscape mode.
Two pages of text will be printed per sheet of paper.
.TP
.B \-m
Format the file as a mail folder, printing multiple messages.
.TP
.B \-o
Format the file as an ordinary ASCII file.
.TP
.BI \-p " prologue"
Employ the file
.I prologue
as the \*(Ps prologue file,
overriding any previously defined file names. Locale prolog file, 
.I prolog.ps,
cannot be overidden with this option. This is specifically for the files in
.B SUPPLIED PROLOGUE FILES
section.
.TP
.BI \-s " subject"
Use
.I " subject"
as the new subject for the printout. If you are printing ordinary ASCII
files which have been specified on the command line, the subject will
default to the name of each of these files.
.TP
.B \-tm
Format the file for use with the Time Manager personal organizer.
.TP
.B \-ts
format the file for use with the Time/System International personal organizer.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number of this release of
.IR mp .
.TP
.BI \-w " words"
The maximum number of words to extract from the gecos field of the users
.I /etc/passwd
entry. The default is 3.
.TP
.B \-?
Print the usage line for
.B mp
(note that the
.B ?
character must be escaped if using
.BR csh (1)).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The location of
.B mp
prologue file which is used for laying out the print page is determined by looking for the environment variable
.IR MP_PROLOGUE ,
which specifies the directory where
.B mp
prologue files are to be found. 
This does not mean that prolog.ps file will be loaded from 
.IR MP_PROLOGUE
directory, only the files listed in the 
.B SUPPLIED PROLOGUE FILES
section will be loaded from this directory.
If
.I MP_PROLOGUE
is not found, then the default directory is assumed
.RI ( /usr/lib/lp/locale/C/mp ).
.LP
.B mp
also checks for the
.I MP_LANG
and
.I LANG
environment variables. If present, then a prologue file called
.RI ( /usr/lib/lp/locale/<localename>/mp/prolog.ps ),
where 
.I <localename> 
is the value of 
.I MP_LANG 
or
.I LANG 
environment variables, 
is prepended to the output to be printed. If this file is not present then a configuration file of the locale called
.RI ( /usr/lib/lp/locale/<localename>/mp/mp.conf )
is used as the source of the configuration information that substitutes the prologue information for printing. Presence of prolog.ps disables mp.conf for backward compatibility.
.SH "SUPPLIED PROLOGUE FILES"
The following prologue files are provided:
.RS
.TP
.I mp.common.ps
Common prolog file for all other files in this directory.
.TP
.I mp.pro.ps
Used by default.
.TP
.I mp.pro.ff.ps
Used if the
.B \-ff
option is in effect.
.TP
.I mp.pro.fp.ps
Used if the
.B \-fp
option is in effect.
.TP
.I mp.pro.tm.ps
Used if the
.B \-tm
option is in effect.
.TP
.I mp.pro.ts.ps
Used if the
.B \-ts
option is in effect.
.TP
.I mp.pro.alt.ps
An alternative modification of the default prologue file which outputs the
page number in the right corner of the bottom banner.

For all above prologue files, there can be localized versions under 
.I /usr/lib/lp/locale/<localename>/mp/. 
If such localized versions available, and the locale specified is the 
.I <localename>, 
the 
.B mp
will use prologue files under the 
.I <localename>
directory.
.TP
.B /usr/lib/lp/locale/<localename>/mp/prolog.ps	
this file provides compatibility with /usr/openwin/bin/mp Type1 printing
for some locales.
